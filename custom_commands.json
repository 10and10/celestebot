I kinda think that Matt Thorson was trolling us by putting this route in the game, and having no way to tell if someone is using explorer mode just by looking at the screen footage. I think they know full well that it's impossible, and the whole thing is little more than a social experiment to see how many people will cheat and then try to pass their work off as legitimate. There is no achievement or reward for beating this route. You don't unlock a special ending where Adelie chips a tooth on the wood chips in your pie. You do get a stamp of a tree on your save file if you complete the route 25 times. But PC players have already learned to hack their save slot to manipulate these stamps - including removing the explorer stamp. \n\nCertain youtubers who shall remain nameless claim to have beaten this route legitimately within a week of the game's release - even going so far as to say that it was fairly easy to do compared to other games they've played. Having carefully inspected their videos and held extensive conversations with them and hearing their conflicting stories about why they were forced to use an explorer mode enabled save to make their videos, but did not have an explorer mode enabled save slot to show at the beginning of the videos, I am 100% certain that these are doctored videos made by nerdowells.", "!tags": "{tags: 100 - 3000, any, hundo, gemskip, nodiag, minballoon}", "!parity": "Parity refers to a state of being even or odd, and whether your position has even or odd-numbered coordinates determines whether certain options, like spike jumps, are possible.

The logic is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the x's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from elimination literature, for instance. The solvers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these puzzles, to realise that they're not just difficult- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Star Battles truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the bravery in the star's existential catchphrase \"\u2605,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Sudoku and Hitari. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those adeliepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Meep's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Battles tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.
