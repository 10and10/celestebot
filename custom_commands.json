I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to key% over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of runners across the world and your PBs are being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can destroy your PBs in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare feet. Not only am I extensively trained in platforming precision, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the best speedrunning equipmemt in the world and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

I kinda think that Matt Thorson was trolling us by putting this route in the game, and having no way to tell if someone is using explorer mode just by looking at the screen footage. I think they know full well that it's impossible, and the whole thing is little more than a social experiment to see how many people will cheat and then try to pass their work off as legitimate. There is no achievement or reward for beating this route. You don't unlock a special ending where Adelie chips a tooth on the wood chips in your pie. You do get a stamp of a tree on your save file if you complete the route 25 times. But PC players have already learned to hack their save slot to manipulate these stamps - including removing the explorer stamp. \n\nCertain youtubers who shall remain nameless claim to have beaten this route legitimately within a week of the game's release - even going so far as to say that it was fairly easy to do compared to other games they've played. Having carefully inspected their videos and held extensive conversations with them and hearing their conflicting stories about why they were forced to use an explorer mode enabled save to make their videos, but did not have an explorer mode enabled save slot to show at the beginning of the videos, I am 100% certain that these are doctored videos made by nerdowells.", "!tags": "{tags: 100 - 3000, any, hundo, gemskip, nodiag, minballoon}", "!parity": "Parity refers to a state of being even or odd, and whether your position has even or odd-numbered coordinates determines whether certain options, like spike jumps, are possible.

These, along with 3 other (much easier) levels, are collectively grouped into \"Everred Spire\", the secret fourth area.\n\nTo reach Everred Spire, you must exit 1000m with only one dash, which will automatically reroute you to the intro level. After that are three levels: Aspiration, Contemplation, and Determination, which are widely regarded as some of the hardest levels in modded Celeste.\n\nUpon clearing these levels, you'll reach Final Approach (a rehash of vanilla 2300m), and then True Summit.
